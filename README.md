## Installation

AppIconKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```


## Support My Work

Maintaining my various [open-source tools][OpenSource] takes significant time and effort. You can [become a sponsor][Sponsors] to help me dedicate more time to creating, maintaining, and improving these projects. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a real difference in keeping these tools free and actively developed. Thank you for considering!



## Getting Started

AppIconKit helps you manage alternate app icons on both macOS and iOS.

The SDK has a couple of central types:

* Use `AlternateAppIcon` to create alternate icon values for your app.
* Use `AlternateAppIconContext` to set and keep track of the current icon. 
* Use `AlternateAppIconCollection` to group icons into related collections.
* Use `AlternateAppIconListItem` when listing an app icon in lits and grids.
* Use `AlternateAppIconShelf` to list app icons in a vertical list of horizontal shelves.

The context will automatically restore the icon on macOS, when a context instance is created.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to enable `Include All App Icon Assets` in the app Info.plist for the app to be able to pick icons. You must add an `.imageset` and an `.appiconset` for each icon, since SwiftUI can't render `.appiconset`s and the OS can't use `.imageset`s as app icon.   



## Documentation

The online [documentation][Documentation] has more information, articles, code examples, etc. 



## Demo Application

The `Demo` folder has a demo app that lets you explore the library and try changing the app icon.
